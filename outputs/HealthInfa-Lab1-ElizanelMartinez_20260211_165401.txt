Patients  
1. Primary care provider considerations 
When I look for a primary care provider, I care a lot about accessibility, if they take my 
insurance, communication, what hospitals they are affiliated with and the ratings they may or 
may not have online. I want someone who is easy to schedule with, actually listens, and doesn’t 
rush through appointments. I’ve had horrible experiences where I felt like the doctor wasn’t 
listening and just wanted to rush through things. I also like when providers explain things clearly 
instead and are able to empathize. Location and whether they take my insurance matter too, since 
that affects how often I’ll realistically go. But because I live in NYC the range is big.  
2. Health insurance plan considerations 
I usually look at the monthly cost versus how expensive it is to actually use the plan. Things like 
deductibles, copays, and prescription coverage matter more to me than just the premium. I also 
check whether doctors I already go to are in network, because out of network costs can get 
expensive fast. But the insurances ive had have been through work and I tend to choose what is 
most affordable and realistic for me.  
3. Medical data I care about tracking and pros/cons of access 
I care about tracking basics like medications, allergies, lab results, and visit summaries. Having 
access through patient portals is helpful because I can double check information, remember what 
was discussed, and share records if I change providers. A downside is that it can be confusing or 
stressful to see results without explanation, and there are always privacy concerns with digital 
data. I also message providers through there and sometime it isn’t clear who I am talking to or 
how long it will take for them to respond.  
4. What makes care high quality 
For me, high quality care means feeling heard and taken seriously. Clear communication, follow 
up, and having a plan moving forward are important. I also think consistency matters, like not 
having to repeat the same information at every visit. The best doctors ive had felt human like 
talking to a trusted friend.  
Providers 
1. Information useful during a patient visit 
1. Medication list and allergies, This helps prevent unsafe prescriptions and drug 
interactions. 
2. Medical history and current symptoms: Knowing past conditions and what the patient 
is currently experiencing helps providers make better decisions and avoid unnecessary 
tests. 
2. One way to evaluate value based care 
Providers could track outcomes like hospital readmissions or whether patients chronic conditions 
are improving over time. If patients are healthier and avoiding repeat visits or complications that 
can suggests care is higher quality and more effective. 
Payers 
 Issues caused by payers and risks payers take on 
Issues caused by payers: 
• 
Prior authorizations can delay care and create extra work for providers. 
• 
Complex coverage rules can confuse patients and lead to unexpected bills. 
Risks payers take on: 
• 
High cost patients or unexpected medical events can lead to large financial losses. 
• 
It’s hard to accurately predict healthcare usage, which creates financial uncertainty. 
2. Using claims data to evaluate value based care 
Claims data can be used to look at total cost of care along with patterns like emergency room 
visits or readmissions. If costs stay reasonable while outcomes improve, it suggests providers are 
delivering value based care.

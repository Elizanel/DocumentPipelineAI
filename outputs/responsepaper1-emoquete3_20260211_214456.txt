Macro and Individual Influences on Health: 
For the two macro or societal-level influences on health I chose workplace policies and benefits, 
and socioeconomic status. Now for the individual-level influence, I chose health beliefs and attitudes 
toward mental health. I believe these factors interact in important ways that shape health behaviors and 
create health disparities, especially around mental health care.  
Workplace policies play a huge role in how people engage with their mental health. Whether it’s 
the employer provided benefits, sick leave policies, and even if mental health is openly supported at work 
directly affect whether someone feels safe seeking care. Like talked about in the multilevel influences on 
health lecture, these institutional-level factors can either support or constrain healthy behaviors (Module 2, 
Lecture 4).  Even if mental health services technically exist, policies alone are not enough. The company 
culture can dictate if people are using the benefits that companies have for them. There are many companies 
where mental health or even taking the day off is looked down upon. Individual beliefs and how easy it is 
for those to shift depending on ones environment matter a lot. If a person believes that talking about mental 
health could hurt their career or make them seem weak, they are less likely to use those benefits. The need 
to have a stable job to be able to life and afford their life or their families many times takes priority. This 
interaction helps explain why two people working at different companies or even in the same company, 
may behave very differently when it comes to mental health support. 
On another note, the companies or workplaces without any clear protection towards individuals 
seeking or wanting to seek these benefits can discourage individuals even those who don’t know if they 
need the benefits.  
Socioeconomic status also interacts strongly with individual health beliefs, like a briefly mentioned 
above. People with higher income and more stable jobs not only can have a different perspective but they 
often have better access to care and more flexibility to take time off which can reinforce the thought that 
seeking help is manageable and worthwhile. But, On the other hand, people with lower income may face 
cost barriers, lack of insurance, unstable work schedules, and just all around have different priorities, may 
experience higher levels of stress and fewer options of care. This can shape beliefs that mental health care 
is inaccessible, not meant for them, or even not worth their while. In many communities, taking care of 
your mental health, going to therapy, etc, seems as not important or something only reserved for the 
privileged. Beliefs like these definitely shape health behaviors. These interactions contribute to health 
disparities because access, beliefs, and outcomes become unevenly distributed across populations. When 
these beliefs interact with unsupportive workplace policies or financial stress, disparities become more 
pronounced. 
These macro and individual factors show that health behaviors are not just about personal choice. 
They are shaped by systems, policies, and social context. When workplace support and economic resources 
are uneven, and when individual beliefs are shaped by stigma or fear, disparities in mental health outcomes 
become more likely. 
Think broadly about a health behavior theory's applicability to digital health design:  
Using a Health Behavior Theory to Design Digital Health Interventions 
The Health Belief Model is a framework for thinking about how digital health interventions can be 
designed, encourage more positive behaviors, and can promote wellbeing as well as reduce health 
disparities. This model focuses on how people perceive health risks, benefits, barriers, and their own ability 
to take actions. This model Is great for digital health tools because it can leverage constructs such as 
perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-
efficacy (Lecture 4)  
Digital health technologies can use the Health Belief Model to increase perceived benefits and 
reduce perceived barriers. Apps that provide educational content can help users recognize symptoms and 
risks, increasing perceived susceptibility and severity. For example, mental health apps often emphasize 
short, manageable activities, which can lower the barrier of time commitment. Notifications and reminders 
act as cues to action, encouraging users to engage with the app consistently. Educational content can 
increase perceived severity and susceptibility by helping users understand the consequences of untreated 
mental health issues. Progress tracking and goal setting features support self-efficacy by showing users that 
small steps can lead to improvement.  
When designed thoughtfully, these features can help address disparities by making support more 
accessible, private, low cost, and flexible. For people who may not feel comfortable seeking in-person care, 
digital tools can offer a lower risk entry point. In this way, the Health Belief Model provides a clear structure 
for designing interventions that align with how people make health decisions. 
Limitations of the Health Belief Model 
While the Health Belief Model is useful, it also has important limitations when applied to digital 
health design. One major weakness is that it focuses heavily on individual decision making and assumes 
people act rationally once barriers are removed. In reality, many barriers to health are due to the structure 
of the health community and not individual. As discussed in the multilevel influences lecture, health 
behaviors are often constrained by factors outside individual control, such as workplace culture, financial 
stress, or discrimination (Module2, Lecture 4). Oyserman et al. (2014) further argue that identity and social 
context strongly influence motivation and behavior. Even if a digital health tool successfully changes 
beliefs, users may still struggle to act if healthy behaviors conflict with their social environment or sense 
of identity. This means that interventions based solely on the Health Belief Model may overestimate the 
impact of changing beliefs without addressing broader systemic issues. As a result, digital tools designed 
using this model alone may be less effective for marginalized populations. 
The model does not fully account for factors like cost, systemic discrimination, or lack of access to 
technology. A digital intervention may increase perceived benefits, but that does not help someone who 
cannot afford a subscription or does not even have reliable internet access. The model also downplays social 
and cultural influences, like stigma or workplace norms, which strongly affect mental health behaviors. 
Because of this, relying just on the Health Belief Model risks placing responsibility on individuals while 
ignoring the broader systems that create and maintain health disparities everyday. 
Health behavior Theory to a Real Tech: 
Description of the Technology 
A commonly used digital health technology is a mental health tracking app, such as a mood tracking or 
wellness app. These apps typically allow users to log their mood, track symptoms, receive reminders, and 
access educational content. Some even include progress dashboards and personalized feedback. Flo is a 
great example of this would be Flo, a period and reproductive health tracking app. log menstrual cycles, 
symptoms, moods, ovulation, pregnancy related data, and general health patterns. Flo provides predictions 
about upcoming periods and fertile windows, personalized insights, educational articles, and health 
reminders. It also includes features like symptom trend visualization, AI generated health explanations, and 
even a feature where you can write to a professional.  
Flo’s goal is to help users better understand their bodies, reproductive health and be able to feel empowered 
about the decisions they make.  
How the Technology Supports Healthy Behaviors 
If I look at Flo through the Health Belief Model from lecture, it actually makes a lot of sense why the app 
works the way it does. The model basically says people are more likely to do something health related if 
they think it applies to them and actually matters. Flo increases perceived susceptibility by constantly 
showing cycle predictions, ovulation windows, and patterns in your symptoms. When you see that you 
might be late or that something looks irregular, because its about your body- it makes you take a second 
look. It is not just general health advice anymore, it is personal. 
It also plays into perceived severity. When the app explains what certain symptoms could mean or 
encourages you to track pain, mood changes, or irregular bleeding, it subtly reinforces that reproductive 
health is important. It makes it feel like if you ignore it might not be good in the long term because you 
won’t have that info to look back to if something happens. That aligns with what we learned in the lecture 
about how people are more likely to act when they believe the outcome matters. 
Flo also uses cues to action, which the Health Belief Model talks about a lot. The reminders and notifications 
are basically little nudges that push you to log your symptoms. I find myself logging them in because of it, 
when my notifications are off I for the most part forget unless the symptoms are affecting me badly. The 
simple cues make the behavior easier to maintain. 
And then there is self efficacy. The app gives you charts, explanations, and trends over time, which makes 
you feel more in control of your body and more informed. I got into my checkups feeling more confident 
and in control. That confidence piece is important, and it connects to what we discussed in Social Cognitive 
Theory too. When you feel like you understand what is happening, you are more likely to keep engaging 
with it. 
That said, the Health Belief Model still feels limited. It focuses a lot on individual beliefs, but it does not 
fully capture bigger issues like access to healthcare, cultural stigma around reproductive health, or whether 
users even feels safe tracking this kind of data. The multilevel influences lecture reminded us that behavior 
is shaped by more than just personal beliefs. So while Flo fits the theory in some ways, it does not fully 
address the broader structural factors that shape health behaviors. 
Design Improvements and Barriers 
One design improvement would be to better incorporate social and identity-based context into the app. For 
example, allowing users to tailor content based on cultural background or workplace environment could 
make the app feel more relevant. However, this could be difficult due to privacy concerns and the challenge 
of collecting sensitive identity data responsibly. 
Another improvement would be integrating stronger connections to external support systems, such as 
workplace resources or community services. While this could reduce structural barriers, it may be hard to 
implement due to differences in employer policies, geographic availability, and liability concerns. These 
challenges highlight the tension between theory-driven design and real-world constraints. 
Two design improvements 
1. More Cultural inclusicivty.  
Flo could better address cultural differences in reproductive health knowledge and stigma. Some users 
may come from backgrounds where discussing menstrual or reproductive health is taboo. Adding 
culturally tailored educational modules or optional community storytelling features could better support 
identity-based motivations and reduce stigma. They do have a feature where everyone that has the app 
can go in and ask questions and many times there you see users cooing together to answer questions 
based on culture or background. But it could be nice to bring a feature like this out and have the 
opportunity to educate those would want to learn more.  
Barriers: 
• 
Cultural tailoring requires significant research and localization. 
• 
Some users may be uncomfortable engaging with community based features. 
• 
There is risk of stereotyping if not done carefully. 
2.  Addressing Structural Barriers  
The Health Belief Model focuses heavily on individual beliefs, but many users face structural barriers 
to care (cost, access, insurance issues). This one could also be a game changer. Flo could include 
localized clinic finders, low-cost care resources, or telehealth referrals based on the users location. 
Barriers: 
• 
Integrating healthcare systems is technically complex. 
• 
There may be liability issues in recommending providers. 
• 
Access varies widely across countries, which makes consistent implementation difficult.
